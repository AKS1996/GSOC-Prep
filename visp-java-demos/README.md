# ViSP Java Demos

This is a collection of demo's and sample usage projects. I used Eclipse while developing them, so I guess they can be exported into Eclipse easily.  
Note that you've to add a user library named `native-manual` for compiling. It must contain two files: `visp_java320.jar` and `libvisp_java320.so`. You can find both of them in `JNI-Usage-Example` section of this repository
